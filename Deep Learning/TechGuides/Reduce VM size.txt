How to reduce VM size
=======================

Refer: http://acidx.net/wordpress/2014/03/how-to-reduce-the-size-of-virtualbox-vms/

After deletion of files, VM size does not reduce. It needs to be reduced as follows:

1. Make a copy of your vdi.

2. Disconnect sharedfolder bdata

3. Fill Free Space With Zeros
==============================
Now boot up your VM and fill the free space with zeros.

	$ cd ~\
	$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/emptyfile bs=1M

In another tab, issue command:
	$ df

Wait till space utilised becomes 100% and dd aborts. dd MUST ABORT.
Now when dd has aborted, delete file:

	$ sudo rm -rf /emptyfile

This will create one big file that only contains zeros. 
The file will get as big as the free space was before, 
so dd will abort when there is no free space left.
Then you just delete the file.

4. Shutdown VM:
	$ poweroff

5. Compact The VDI
On Windows in the c:\program files\oracle\VirtualBox  folder, look for exe files.
And issue command:

	c:\>VBoxManage modifyhd e:\vm2\centos1.vdi --compact
