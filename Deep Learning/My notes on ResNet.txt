My notes on Deep Residual Network
=================================

The output after the first block:

H(X) = F(X) + X

Output after the IInd block:

H(X') = F(X') + X'
where X' = F(X) + X

Output after the IIIrd block:

H(X") = F(X") + X"
where X" = F(X") + X"

Thus output of earlier block is not only the input
to the next block but is also added as an identity.
